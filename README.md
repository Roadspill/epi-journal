## My Morning
The day started with cuddling my dog and a cup of coffee. I had a gripping headache so I switched up to water prior to heading to work.

## My Work Day
Once I got to work I went through the mail, filed reports, and bought my clients some new items for their home. Right now I'm working to move paperwork into digital files to create more space and remove clutter. Then I went to Costco! It was crazy busy for a Wednesday afternoon, wasn't expecting that! Had a Costco dog, delicious cheap date.

## My Evening
After work was finished I headed off to my lesson in coding at [Epicodus](https://epicodus.com). It's been fun and _interesting_ to say the least. Pair programming helps me learn faster and get to know my fellow students.

I learned how to make a directory by using `mkdir hello-world`.

## **Dreaming of**
After class I'm hoping to go get some of my favorite food, **BBQ Pork Mac & Cheese** bowl with bacon from **[Noodles and Co](https://noodles.com)**.

### Spiritually Walking
On the beach in Tahiti.
